Regarding Withdrawal/Deposit initialization:
  - Requires user to sign valid challenge (SEP10) transaction.
  - Requires creation of Transfer object on backend, for tracking status updates, and redirecting KYC if necessary.
  - Frontend must be able to show these changes as it relates to internal logic on transfer status (does transaction require KYC), in context of the individual transfer
  
  
Regarding Testnet wallet workflow:
  - Testnet anchor registers wallet as a user
  - Testnet anchor registers new transfer request with the anchor
  - Testnet anchor redirects to KYC server if required
  - Transfer is either greenlit or rejected depending on KYC status from SumSub webhook (I assume?)
  - Funds are then released to or accepted from the user if transfer is valid, transfer marked as completed.
